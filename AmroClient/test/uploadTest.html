enctype="multipart/form-data" - Necessary for our to-be-created PHP file to function properly.
action="uploader.php" - The name of our PHP page that will be created, shortly.
method="POST" - Informs the browser that we want to send information to the server using POST.
input type="hidden" name="MA... - Sets the maximum allowable file size, in bytes, that can be uploaded. This safety mechanism is easily bypassed and we will show a solid backup solution in PHP. We have set the max file size to 100KB in this example.
input name="uploadedfile" - uploadedfile is how we will access the file in our PHP script.
